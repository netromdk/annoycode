# annoycode
Annoy people by converting Unicode characters to other characters that looks the same. It could be symbols like 'V' and the Roman literal five 'V'. Imagine a path with unicode characters where an "Ã¥" is not U+00E5 but an "a" (U+0061) with a circle over it (U+030A). That of course means that the path doesn't exist even thought it looks exactly like the original one.

The project was born due to a similar path/Unicode bug at the office.

The program takes either a string or a file as input.
